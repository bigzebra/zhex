The ZHex distribution uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker. To build ZHex, use the steps 
typically used to build an ExtUtils::MakeMaker module:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

ZHex is organized as a Perl module. The main program, named 'zhexsh.pl' uses 
the ZHex.pm module, which in turn uses several more modules from the directory 
'ZHex'.

Once installed, invoke ZHex by calling zhexsh.pl from the command line:

	> zhexsh.pl --file some.exe
